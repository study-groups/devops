# Development Guidelines
- Only reason about Bash shell scripting (POSIX + bashisms).
- Keep answers short and strictly technical.
- No long explanations unless explicitly asked.
- Prefer patches or small diffs over full file rewrites.
- Do not repeat code already shown unless changes are requested.
- Assume an experienced user (no step-by-step beginner tutorials).

# Project Context
- Source files are in ./
- Only include file names if asked.
- Do not expand unrelated directories.
- When asked to fix an error, analyze only the snippet given.

# Output Rules
- Use fenced code blocks with the language tag (```bash).
- Omit greetings, apologies, and conversational fluff.
- When showing diffs, use minimal unified diff format.
- When describing, use one short paragraph maximum.

# Review Instructions
- Summarize context rather than echoing full code unless needed.
- Avoid restating unchanged sections.
- Prefer bullet points for change explanations.

# Token Budgeting
- Avoid repeating the entire conversation history.
- Reference earlier answers instead of reprinting them.
- Ask before expanding into long explanations.
