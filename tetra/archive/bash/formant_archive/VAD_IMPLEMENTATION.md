# Voice Activity Detection (VAD) Implementation

## Overview

A comprehensive Voice Activity Detection system has been added to the formant speech synthesis engine, enabling automatic speech detection for hands-free recording.

## Architecture

### Multi-Feature Detection

The VAD uses **three complementary features** for robust speech detection:

1. **Short-Time Energy (STE)**
   - RMS energy calculation per 10ms frame
   - Adaptive threshold based on noise floor
   - Speech typically has **higher** energy than silence

2. **Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR)**
   - Counts sign changes in audio signal
   - Voiced speech has **lower** ZCR
   - Unvoiced sounds/noise have higher ZCR

3. **Spectral Flatness (SF)** (time-domain approximation)
   - Measures harmonic vs noise-like content
   - Speech (harmonic) has **lower** flatness
   - Noise (white) has higher flatness

### Decision Logic

Speech is detected when **all three features agree**:
```c
speech = (energy > energy_threshold) &&
         (zcr < zcr_threshold) &&
         (sf < sf_threshold)
```

### State Machine

```
SILENCE → SPEECH_START → SPEECH → SPEECH_END → SILENCE
           ↑                                      ↓
           └──────────── (speech continues) ──────┘
```

**States:**
- `SILENCE` - No speech detected, pre-trigger buffering active
- `SPEECH_START` - Speech confirmed (after min_speech_frames)
- `SPEECH` - Active speech being recorded
- `SPEECH_END` - Hangover period (continues briefly after silence)

### Key Features

#### Pre-Trigger Buffer
- **Size**: 100ms (1600 samples @ 16kHz)
- **Purpose**: Captures speech onset before detection
- **Implementation**: Circular buffer, always recording
- **Result**: No clipped beginnings!

#### Hangover
- **Purpose**: Avoid cutting off speech endings
- **Duration**:
  - Mode 0 (Quality): 300ms
  - Mode 1 (Balanced): 200ms
  - Mode 2 (Aggressive): 100ms

#### Adaptive Thresholds
- **Noise floor**: Learned from initial silence
- **Updates**: Slow exponential moving average during silence
- **Energy threshold**: `noise_floor × energy_multiplier`
  - Mode 0: 2.5×
  - Mode 1: 3.0×
  - Mode 2: 4.0×

```

**VAD Mode (new):**
```
RECORD_VAD <phoneme> <max_duration_ms> <filename> [vad_mode]
```

### VAD Modes

| Mode | Name | Energy Mult | ZCR Thresh | SF Thresh | Hangover | Min Speech | Use Case |
|------|------|-------------|------------|-----------|----------|------------|----------|
| 0 | Quality | 2.5× | 0.35 | 0.50 | 300ms | 20ms | Clean recordings, low noise |
| 1 | Balanced | 3.0× | 0.30 | 0.45 | 200ms | 30ms | Most environments (default) |
| 2 | Aggressive | 4.0× | 0.25 | 0.40 | 100ms | 40ms | Noisy environments |

### Testing

```bash
# Quick VAD test
./test_vad.sh

# Test fixed-duration recording (comparison)
./test_record.sh

# Full voice cloning with VAD
cd voice_cloning
./record_phonemes_vad.sh my_voice
```

### Example Recording Session

```bash
# Start formant engine
./bin/formant -s 16000 -i /tmp/formant_input &

# Record vowels with VAD
echo "RECORD_VAD a 5000 recordings/a.wav 1" > /tmp/formant_input
# [System waits for speech, records automatically, stops when done]

echo "RECORD_VAD e 5000 recordings/e.wav 1" > /tmp/formant_input
# [Repeat for each phoneme]
```

## Performance

### Latency
- **Frame size**: 10ms (160 samples @ 16kHz)
- **Detection delay**: 20-40ms (min_speech_frames × frame_size)
- **Real-time**: Yes, processes in audio callback

### Accuracy
- **Multi-feature approach**: Reduces false positives/negatives
- **Adaptive**: Adjusts to background noise
- **Robust**: Works in various environments

### Memory
- **VAD structure**: ~500 bytes
- **Pre-trigger buffer**: 1600 samples × 4 bytes = 6.4 KB @ 16kHz
- **History buffers**: 5 frames × 2 features × 4 bytes = 40 bytes
- **Total**: ~7 KB per recorder instance

## Algorithm Details

### Energy Calculation
```c
energy = sqrt(sum(samples[i]^2) / frame_size)
threshold = noise_floor × energy_multiplier
```

### Zero-Crossing Rate
```c
for (i = 1; i < frame_size; i++) {
    if (sign(samples[i]) != sign(samples[i-1]))
        crossings++;
}
zcr = crossings / (frame_size - 1)
```

### Spectral Flatness (Time-Domain Approximation)
```c
mean_abs = sum(abs(samples[i])) / frame_size
variance = sum((abs(samples[i]) - mean_abs)^2) / frame_size
spectral_flatness = sqrt(variance) / mean_abs
```

### Noise Floor Adaptation
```c
// Exponential moving average (α = 0.95)
noise_floor = 0.95 × noise_floor + 0.05 × energy
```
