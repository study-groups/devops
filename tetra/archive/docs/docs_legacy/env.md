In Bash, when a command is executed, the [exec](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#24%2C14-24%2C14) system call is used to replace the current process image with a new one. When using [env](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#24%2C19-24%2C19) to run a command, the process of setting up standard I/O and passing environment variables works as follows:

### Process Flow with [env](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#24%2C19-24%2C19)

1. **[env](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#24%2C19-24%2C19) Command Execution**:
   - When you run a command with [env](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#24%2C19-24%2C19), [env](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#24%2C19-24%2C19) itself is executed as a separate process.
   - [env](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#24%2C19-24%2C19) then parses the command line arguments, including any environment variable assignments and the actual command to be executed.

2. **Environment Variable Handling**:
   - [env](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#24%2C19-24%2C19) processes the environment variable assignments provided on the command line.
   - It sets up the environment variables based on these assignments.

3. **Command Execution**:
   - After setting up the environment, [env](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#24%2C19-24%2C19) uses the [exec](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#24%2C14-24%2C14) system call to replace itself with the specified command.
   - The specified command inherits the modified environment set up by [env](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#24%2C19-24%2C19).

4. **[exec](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#24%2C14-24%2C14) System Call**:
   - The [exec](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#24%2C14-24%2C14) system call loads the new program into the current process space, replacing the current program.
   - This new program inherits the file descriptors, environment, and other process attributes from the calling process (in this case, [env](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#24%2C19-24%2C19)).

5. **Standard I/O Setup**:
   - Before the [exec](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#24%2C14-24%2C14) call, standard I/O (stdin, stdout, stderr) is typically set up as per the shell's configuration.
   - After the [exec](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#24%2C14-24%2C14), the standard I/O streams are inherited by the new program, maintaining the I/O behavior.

### Environment Variable Passing

- **Environment Inheritance**: When [env](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#24%2C19-24%2C19) uses [exec](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#24%2C14-24%2C14) to run the specified command, the new command inherits the environment variables set up by [env](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#24%2C19-24%2C19).
- **Environment Modification**: [env](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#24%2C19-24%2C19) allows you to modify the environment variables passed to the command without affecting the global environment.

### Key Points

- **[exec](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#24%2C14-24%2C14) Behavior**: The [exec](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#24%2C14-24%2C14) system call replaces the current process with a new one, inheriting certain attributes like environment variables and file descriptors.
- **[env](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#24%2C19-24%2C19) Functionality**: [env](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#24%2C19-24%2C19) acts as an intermediary to modify the environment before executing a command, providing flexibility in setting up the execution environment.

### Summary

- When using [env](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#24%2C19-24%2C19) to run a command, the [env](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#24%2C19-24%2C19) process sets up the environment and then uses [exec](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#24%2C14-24%2C14) to replace itself with the specified command, passing the modified environment to the new command. This allows for controlled environment variable passing and modification before executing the desired command.
