# Engine Refactoring Complete

## Summary

The Pulsar game engine has been successfully refactored from a monolithic 1422-line `pulsar.c` file into a clean, modular architecture with proper separation of concerns.

## New File Structure

### Header Files (5)
- **types.h** - Common types and constants (Sprite, GamepadState, Event, PUID_Account, etc.)
- **layout.h** - Terminal layout management with resizing support
- **ui.h** - UI rendering and panel management
- **input.h** - Input handling (keyboard, gamepad)
- **render.h** - Sprite and game rendering

### Implementation Files (5)
- **pulsar.c** - Main entry point and command processing (630 lines, down from 1422)
- **layout.c** - Layout calculations and region management
- **ui.c** - All UI panel rendering logic
- **input.c** - Input polling and processing
- **render.c** - Sprite rendering with play area constraints

### Existing Files
- **toml.h / toml.c** - Configuration parsing (unchanged)

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Resizable Layout System
- Dynamic layout calculation based on terminal size
- Automatic region adjustments when panels are toggled
- Play area automatically resizes to avoid overlapping panels

### 2. Sticky Bottom Panel
- Event log (Panel 2) always sticks to the bottom 4 lines
- Automatically adjusts position when terminal is resized
- Properly clears and redraws on resize events

### 3. Tabbed '9' Key View
- Press '9' to open configuration panel as a centered overlay (70% of screen)
- Shows environment variables, config files, layout info, controls
- Press '9' again to close
- Tab indicator in panel title

### 4. Panel System
```
Panel 1: Debug info (top, 3 lines)
Panel 2: Event log (bottom, 4 lines, STICKY)
Panel 3: Player stats (right side, 30 chars)
Panel 4: Mapping debug (left side)
Panel 9: Configuration tab (center overlay)
```

### 5. Modular Architecture Benefits
- **Separation of concerns** - Each module has a single responsibility
- **Easier testing** - Individual modules can be tested in isolation
- **Better maintainability** - Changes localized to specific modules
- **Cleaner code** - Main file reduced from 1422 to 630 lines
- **Type safety** - Proper header files with clear interfaces

## Build System

Updated Makefile with:
```makefile
SOURCES = src/pulsar.c \
          src/layout.c \
          src/ui.c \
          src/input.c \
          src/render.c \
          src/toml.c

HEADERS = src/types.h \
          src/layout.h \
          src/ui.h \
          src/input.h \
          src/render.h
```

Clean builds with zero warnings!

## Terminal Resizing Support

The layout system now properly handles terminal resize:
- `layout_resize()` updates all panel regions
- `ui_resize()` updates UI context
- `render_resize()` updates render context
- Play area automatically recalculates to avoid panels

## Key Controls

### Panel Toggles
- `1` - Debug info panel
- `2` - Event log (sticky bottom)
- `3` - Player stats
- `4` - Mapping debug
- `9` - **Configuration tab (NEW!)**
- `0` - Hide all panels

### Game Controls
- `h` - Help overlay
- `p` - Pause/resume
- `q` - Quit
- `WASD` - Left stick simulation
- `IJKL` - Right stick simulation

## Code Statistics

### Before Refactoring
- 1 monolithic file: 1422 lines
- All functionality mixed together
- Difficult to navigate and maintain

### After Refactoring
- 12 files total (5 headers, 5 implementations, 2 toml)
- Main file: 630 lines (56% reduction)
- Clear module boundaries
- Easy to extend and maintain

## Module Responsibilities

### layout.c
- Calculate panel positions and sizes
- Handle terminal resize events
- Manage play area boundaries
- Toggle panel visibility

### ui.c
- Draw all UI panels
- Render help overlay
- Draw pause indicator
- Manage UI state (CPU usage, pause, etc.)

### input.c
- Poll gamepad input (non-blocking)
- Read keyboard input
- Simulate gamepad from keyboard
- Debounce and log input events

### render.c
- Render sprites within play area
- Handle sprite animation
- Apply valence-based colors
- Respect layout boundaries

### pulsar.c
- Command processing
- Game loop coordination
- Sprite management
- Process lifecycle

## Next Steps

To use the refactored engine:

```bash
cd /Users/mricos/src/devops/tetra/bash/game
source ~/tetra/tetra.sh
game quadrapole
```

The engine will now:
1. Start with resizable layout
2. Support sticky bottom panel for events
3. Allow '9' key tab view for configuration
4. Properly handle terminal resizing
5. Maintain clean modular code structure

## Testing

Engine builds successfully:
```bash
cd engine
make clean && make
# Built: bin/pulsar (zero warnings)
```

Basic test passes:
```bash
echo "QUIT" | ./bin/pulsar
# OK READY
# OK QUIT
```

All modules compile cleanly with `-Wall -Wextra -pedantic`.

## Backup

Original file backed up to:
- `engine/src/pulsar.c.backup` (1422 lines)

## Conclusion

The refactoring is complete and the engine is ready for use. The modular structure makes it much easier to:
- Add new panel types
- Extend input handling
- Improve rendering
- Add new layout modes
- Maintain and debug code

All while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing game interface!
