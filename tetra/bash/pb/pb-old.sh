PM2 Port Process Manager Helper

Usage:
  pb start <path/to/scriptname.sh> [custom_name] - Start a script with PM2
  pb stop <process1 process2 ... | *>            - Stop processes
  pb delete|kill <process1 process2 ... | *>     - Delete processes
  pb restart <process1 process2 ... | *>         - Restart processes
  pb ls                                          - List all PM2 processes
  pb logs <process1 process2 ... | *>            - Show logs for processes
  pb ports                                       - List all running scripts with ports
  pb help                                        - Show this help message

Examples:
  pb start path/to/scriptname.sh                 - Start script with default name (scriptname-PORT)
  pb start path/to/scriptname.sh myapp           - Start script with custom name (myapp-PORT)
  pb stop scriptname-8080                        - Stop process
  pb stop *                                      - Stop all processes
  pb kill *                                      - Delete all processes
  pb logs scriptname-8080                        - Show logs for process

PORT Detection:
  The script will look for PORT in the following order:
  1. Environment variable: PORT=8080
  2. Script file: PORT=8080 or export PORT=8080
