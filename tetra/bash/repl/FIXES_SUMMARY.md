# REPL Fixes Summary

## COMPLETED

### 1. Slash Command Routing (WORKING)
- Simplified augment mode: ALL `/commands` go to `repl_dispatch_slash()`  
- Updated dispatcher with 4-tier priority:
  1. Module registered handlers (REPL_SLASH_HANDLERS) - can override
  2. Built-in meta-commands (help, exit, mode, theme)
  3. Action system dispatch (tetra_dispatch_action)
  4. Unknown error
- Test: `/status` works, `/help` works

### 2. Color Fixes (WORKING)
- Fixed blue-on-blue invisible text
- Changed all palette color functions to use `text_color()` instead of `fg_color()`
- Output now: `[38;5;33m` (foreground only)

### 3. Input Escape Sequences (WORKING)
- Fixed cursor control codes leaking into input
- Redirected tput output to stderr in tcurses_input.sh

### 4. Emojis (DONE)
- Removed from test_repl.sh and demo_symbols.sh

## PARTIAL - NEEDS MORE WORK

### Symbol Processing  
**Status**: @ symbol works, :: and # have issues

**Working**:
- Symbol parsing (repl_parse_symbols) correctly extracts tokens
- @ symbol handler is called and works
- # symbol handler is called correctly

**NOT Working**:
- :: symbol handler not being invoked (reason unknown)
- Symbol replacement logic has bugs - creates duplicates
- Handler stderr output leaking into result

**Root Cause**: The symbol replacement in `symbol_parser.sh` lines 82-117 has logic errors:
1. String replacement pattern `${processed//@$token/$resolved}` may not match correctly
2. Multiple symbols in same input interfere with each other
3. Need better debugging to understand the flow

## RECOMMENDATION

Symbol processing needs a rewrite with:
1. Better separation of parsing vs processing
2. Clear handler invocation with proper stdout/stderr handling
3. Symbol replacement that works with multiple symbols
4. Test each symbol type independently first
