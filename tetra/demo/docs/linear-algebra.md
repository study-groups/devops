# Mathematical Model: Linear Algebra Foundations

## Overview

The TView system is built on linear algebra concepts, specifically **group actions** and **matrix operations**. This mathematical foundation provides a formal framework for understanding system behavior and ensuring consistent operations.

## Core Mathematical Concepts

### Group Action: A acting on X

In abstract algebra, a **group action** is a way for elements of a group A to act on elements of a set X:

```
φ: A × X → X
```

Where:
- **A**: Group of actions (operations we can perform)
- **X**: Set of states (system states we can transform)
- **φ**: The action function (how operations transform states)

### TView Implementation

In our system:
- **A**: Set of available actions (ACTION_DEF instances)
- **X**: System states (Environment × Mode combinations)
- **φ**: Action execution (how actions transform system state)

## Formula Decomposition

### E × M + A = R

This can be expressed as matrix operations:

```
E = [DEMO, LOCAL, REMOTE]ᵀ        (3×1 environment vector)
M = [LEARN, BUILD, TEST]ᵀ         (3×1 mode vector)
A = [a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ]ᵀ           (n×1 action vector)
R = f(E, M, A)                    (result function)
```

### Context Matrix (E × M)

The environment-mode combination creates a **context matrix**:

```
     LEARN  BUILD  TEST
DEMO   c₁₁    c₁₂   c₁₃
LOCAL  c₂₁    c₂₂   c₂₃
REMOTE c₃₁    c₃₂   c₃₃
```

Each cell `cᵢⱼ` represents a valid context that can have associated actions.

### Action Vector Space

Actions form a **vector space** where:
- **Basis vectors**: Fundamental operations (create, read, update, delete, execute)
- **Linear combinations**: Complex actions composed of fundamental operations
- **Orthogonality**: Independent actions that don't interfere

## Verb × Nouns Model

### Mathematical Representation

```
Action = Verb ⊗ Nouns

Where:
- Verb: 1×1 operation matrix (for now)
- Nouns: n×1 context vector
- ⊗: Tensor product (operation applied to context)
```

### Example Decomposition

```bash
# SSH Test Action
Verb = [ssh_test]                    (1×1 operation)
Nouns = [host, user, port, timeout]ᵀ (4×1 context vector)

# Result: ssh_test applied to (host, user, port, timeout)
Action = ssh_test ⊗ [host, user, port, timeout]ᵀ
```

### Noun Resolution Timing

Nouns can be resolved at different times, creating **temporal vectors**:

```
Nouns_creation = [timeout, options]ᵀ     (known at definition time)
Nouns_runtime = [host, user, port]ᵀ      (resolved at execution time)

Total_Nouns = Nouns_creation ⊕ Nouns_runtime  (direct sum)
```

## State Transformations

### State Space

System state can be represented as:
```
S = (E, M, A_current, Context)

Where:
- E ∈ {DEMO, LOCAL, REMOTE}
- M ∈ {LEARN, BUILD, TEST}
- A_current ∈ Available_Actions(E, M)
- Context ∈ Resolved_Variables(E, M)
```

### Transformation Functions

```
Navigation: S₁ → S₂  (changing E, M, or A_current)
Execution:  S → R    (applying action to current state)
Refresh:    S → S'   (updating context while preserving selections)
```

## Linear Operations

### Action Composition

Actions can be composed using linear operations:

```
Parallel: A₁ ⊕ A₂ (direct sum - independent execution)
Sequential: A₁ ∘ A₂ (composition - chained execution)
Conditional: A₁ ⊗ P (tensor with predicate - conditional execution)
```

### Example: Deploy Workflow

```
Deploy = Validate ∘ Build ∘ Test ∘ Deploy ∘ Verify

Mathematically:
Deploy(context) = (Verify ∘ Deploy ∘ Test ∘ Build ∘ Validate)(context)
```

## Group Properties

### TView Action Group

The set of all actions forms a **monoid** under composition:
1. **Closure**: Composing actions yields actions
2. **Associativity**: (A₁ ∘ A₂) ∘ A₃ = A₁ ∘ (A₂ ∘ A₃)
3. **Identity**: No-op action exists
4. **Invertibility**: Some actions have rollback operations

### Environment Group

Environments form a **cycle group** under navigation:
```
DEMO → LOCAL → REMOTE → DEMO → ...
```

This is isomorphic to **Z/3Z** (integers modulo 3).

## Practical Applications

### Action Discovery Algorithm

Given context (E, M), find valid actions:
```
Valid_Actions(E, M) = {A ∈ All_Actions | E ∈ A.environments ∧ M ∈ A.modes}
```

### Context Resolution

Resolve action nouns in environment context:
```
Resolved_Action = Verb ⊗ (Nouns_creation ⊕ Resolve_Runtime(Nouns_runtime, E))
```

### State Transition Validation

Ensure state transitions preserve system invariants:
```
Valid_Transition(S₁, S₂) = Invariants(S₁) ⊆ Invariants(S₂)
```

## Future Extensions

### Multi-Verb Actions

Currently verbs are 1×1 matrices. Future versions could support:
```
Verb_Matrix = [v₁ v₂ v₃]  (1×3 parallel operations)
             [v₄ v₅ v₆]  (composition could be 2×3 or higher)
```

### Tensor Action Spaces

Complex actions could use tensor products:
```
Complex_Action = Simple_Action₁ ⊗ Simple_Action₂ ⊗ ... ⊗ Simple_Actionₙ
```

### Eigenaction Analysis

Find "characteristic actions" that define system behavior:
```
A · v = λ · v  (where A is action, v is system state, λ is eigenvalue)
```

This mathematical foundation ensures TView operations are:
- **Predictable**: Mathematical properties guarantee behavior
- **Composable**: Operations can be combined systematically
- **Verifiable**: Formal methods can validate correctness
- **Extensible**: New operations fit into existing framework
