In the [tetra_pm_start](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#5%2C11-5%2C11) function, the [base_command](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#60%2C3-60%2C3) and `full_command` are closely related to the [entrypoint](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#59%2C3-59%2C3) and the overall [command](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#19%2C29-19%2C29) that is executed within a new tmux session. Here's a detailed explanation of how these components interact:

### Variables and Concepts
1. **[entrypoint](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#59%2C3-59%2C3)**:
   - This variable represents the path to the script that will be executed as part of the process management. It is typically located within a directory specified by [process_dir](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#59%2C18-59%2C18) and is named `entrypoint.sh`.
   - **Path**: `\${process_dir}/entrypoint.sh`

2. **[command](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#19%2C29-19%2C29)**:
   - This is the actual command that gets executed within the tmux session. It involves changing the directory to [process_dir](file:///Users/mricos/src/devops-study-group/tetra/bash/pm.sh#59%2C18-59%2C18) and then executing the `entrypoint.sh` script.
   - **Command**: `cd \${process_dir} && ./entrypoint.sh`

### Function Calls and Their Roles
1. **`base_command`**:
   - Generated by the function `construct_command()`, this command sets up the environment in which the `entrypoint.sh` will be executed. It typically involves setting a clean environment with specific PATH settings and ensuring that no user profiles or rc files interfere with the script execution.
   - **Purpose**: To ensure that the `entrypoint.sh` script runs in a controlled and predictable environment, which is crucial for process management systems where consistency is key.

2. **`full_command`**:
   - This is a combination of the `base_command` and the `command`. The `base_command` sets the environment, and the `command` specifies what actually needs to be executed in that environment.
   - **Construction**: The `full_command` is essentially the `base_command` followed by the `command`, encapsulated in such a way that the environment settings apply to the execution of the `command`.

### How They Relate
- The `base_command` prepares the environment for the `command` to execute successfully. It ensures that when the `command` runs, it does so with the correct settings that might not be the default on the system where the script is running.
- The `command` (`cd \${process_dir} && ./entrypoint.sh`) is the direct action taken within the environment prepared by the `base_command`. It ensures that the `entrypoint.sh` script is executed in its intended directory, which is crucial for scripts that depend on relative paths or specific working directory contexts.

### Practical Usage in `tetra_pm_start`
- When a new tmux session is started, the `base_command` is first evaluated to set up the environment.
- The `full_command` then executes within this environment, ensuring that the `entrypoint.sh` script runs exactly as intended, unaffected by external environment variables or settings that could alter its behavior.

This relationship between the `base_command` and the `full_command` with respect to the `entrypoint` and the overall `command` is fundamental in ensuring that processes are managed consistently and reliably within the `tetra_pm` system.
