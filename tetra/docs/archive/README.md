# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation that has been superseded by the consolidated core documentation but retained for reference.

## Current Core Documentation (docs/)

The Tetra documentation has been consolidated into 4 core documents:

1. **README.md** - Project overview + quick start guide
2. **TES.md** - Tetra Endpoint Specification (the nouns - where things are)
3. **DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md** - Building modules and actions (the verbs - what to do)
4. **CORE_SPECIFICATION.md** - TCS 4.0 technical reference (the foundation)
