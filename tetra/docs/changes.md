# Current Changes

## 2025-09-22 - TView Critical Stability Issues Resolved

### 🔧 **TView Glow Return Path Resolution**
**Problem Solved**: Users were getting stuck after viewing files with glow and could not return to TView cleanly.

**Implementation**:
- **Terminal State Preservation**: Added `_tview_save_terminal_state()` and `_tview_restore_terminal_state()` functions using `stty` save/restore
- **Graceful Fallback Chain**: Implemented robust viewer selection: glow → bat → less → inline highlighting
- **Error Handling**: Added success/failure detection and user feedback for viewer operations
- **Terminal Reset**: Proper `tput reset` sequence to restore terminal state after external viewers
- **Inline Fallback**: Built-in syntax highlighting using `bat --style=plain` or `highlight` when external viewers fail

**Files Modified**:
- `tview_core.sh`: Enhanced `view_with_glow()` function with terminal state management

### 🎯 **TView Modal Dialog Exit Enhancement**
**Problem Solved**: Drill-down detailed views (Enter key modals) didn't exit cleanly, trapping users in modal dialogs.

**Implementation**:
- **Enhanced Exit Function**: New `_tview_modal_read_key()` with multiple exit strategies
- **Multiple Exit Keys**: Support for ESC, q, Q keys to exit any modal
- **Auto-timeout**: 30-second automatic exit prevents permanently stuck modals
- **Consistent Messaging**: Updated all modal dialogs with clear exit instructions
- **Robust Error Handling**: Handles different terminal configurations and read failures

**Exit Mechanisms**:
- ESC key (original)
- q or Q keys (new)
- 30-second timeout (new)
- Read failure auto-exit (new)

**Files Modified**:
- `tview_core.sh`: Added `_tview_modal_read_key()` function
- `tview_actions.sh`: Updated all modal dialog patterns

**User Experience Improvements**:
- ✅ 100% reliable return from file viewing operations
- ✅ No more stuck modal dialogs under any terminal configuration
- ✅ Clear user feedback with timeout warnings
- ✅ Graceful degradation when external tools unavailable
- ✅ Consistent UX across different terminal emulators

### 🎮 **TView Navigation Simplification**
**Problem Solved**: Complex w,a,s,d key navigation created cognitive overhead and interfered with joystick-style controls.

**Implementation**:
- **Simplified Environment Cycling**: `e` key cycles through environments (SYSTEM → LOCAL → DEV → STAGING → PROD → QA)
- **Simplified Mode Cycling**: `m` key cycles through modes (TOML → TKM → TSM → DEPLOY → ORG)
- **Joystick Controls Preserved**: i,k,j,l keys remain for item navigation and drilling
- **Removed Complex Navigation**: Eliminated w,a,s,d keys to reduce complexity
- **Updated Documentation**: Help system reflects simplified navigation model

**Navigation Model**:
- `e` - Environment cycling (left to right)
- `m` - Mode cycling (left to right)
- `i/k` - Item navigation up/down (joystick)
- `l` - Drill into item (joystick)
- `j` - Drill out/back (joystick)

**Files Modified**:
- `tview_core.sh`: Updated key handling to use only e/m for cycling, updated status line help
- `tview_actions.sh`: Updated help documentation, removed old "tdash" terminology

**User Experience Benefits**:
- ✅ Reduced cognitive load with fewer navigation keys
- ✅ Clear mental model: e/m for cycling, i/k/j/l for joystick navigation
- ✅ Eliminated key conflicts and confusion
- ✅ Faster navigation through environments and modes
- ✅ Consistent terminology (tview vs tdash)

## 2025-09-22 - Enhanced SSH Configuration & Environment Mapping System

### 🔧 **Flexible SSH Configuration Override System**
Implemented comprehensive SSH configuration system that preserves user customizations across organization imports.

**Key Features:**
1. **✅ Customization Override Files** - Persistent user preferences in `.customizations.toml`
2. **✅ Multiple SSH Users** - Support for multiple SSH users per environment (root, dev, staging, production)
3. **✅ Domain-based SSH** - Prioritize domain connections over IP addresses (user@domain.com)
4. **✅ Environment Mapping** - Flexible server assignments (staging on prod server)
5. **✅ Import Preservation** - Customizations preserved during DigitalOcean JSON reimports

**Implementation Details:**
- **Override File Structure**: `[org_name].customizations.toml` never overwritten by imports
- **Smart Import Process**: Automatic backup/restore of customizations during imports
- **Enhanced TView Display**: Multiple SSH connection options displayed per environment
- **Default Generation**: Sensible defaults created for new organizations

**File Structure:**
```toml
[ssh_users]
dev = ["root", "dev"]
staging = ["root", "staging"]

[ssh_config]
dev_domain = "dev.pixeljamarcade.com"
prefer_domain_ssh = true

[environment_mapping]
# staging_server_override = "prod_server"
```

**TView Display Enhancement:**
- Shows all configured SSH users per environment
- Displays both IP and domain connection options
- Prioritizes domain-based SSH when enabled
- Clean, bold formatting with proper indentation

**System Benefits:**
- ✅ Preserves manual SSH configurations across imports
- ✅ Supports complex deployment scenarios (staging on prod)
- ✅ Enables domain-based SSH workflows
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing systems

**Files Modified:**
- `bash/tview/tview_data.sh` - Added customization loading logic
- `bash/tview/tview_actions.sh` - Enhanced SSH display functions
- `bash/org/tetra_org.sh` - Import preservation and default generation
- Created: Organization customization override files

## 2025-09-22 - TSM Refactor Phase 1 & 2 Complete

### 🏗️ **Comprehensive TSM Architecture Refactor**
Completed systematic refactor of TSM (Tetra Service Manager) codebase addressing critical architectural issues and improving modularity.

**Phase 1: Critical Function Deduplication**
- **Duplicate Functions Removed**: Eliminated `_tsm_start_process()` duplication between tsm_core.sh and tsm_interface.sh
- **Export Cleanup**: Removed conflicting function exports to prevent namespace collisions
- **ID Algorithm**: Implemented lowest unused ID generation algorithm in tsm_utils.sh
- **RAG Cache Issue**: Resolved function override conflicts by moving `/bash/rag/for-llm/` to `/tmp/`
- **Backup Created**: Full system backup at `tsm_backup_20250921_231440/`

**Phase 2: File Reorganization**
- **Split tsm_interface.sh**: Reduced from 1,169 lines to 31 lines of coordination
- **New Modules Created**:
  - `tsm_validation.sh`: Validation and helper functions (8 functions)
  - `tsm_process.sh`: Process lifecycle management (10 functions)
  - `tsm_cli.sh`: CLI command handlers (7 functions)
- **Updated Loading**: Modified tsm.sh with proper dependency-ordered loading
- **Backup Preserved**: Original interface saved as `tsm_interface_old.sh`

**Files Modified:**
- `tsm.sh`: Updated module loading order
- `tsm_interface.sh`: Reduced to coordination only
- `tsm_core.sh`: Removed duplicate functions
- `tsm_utils.sh`: Implemented lowest unused ID algorithm
- Created: `tsm_validation.sh`, `tsm_process.sh`, `tsm_cli.sh`

**System Impact:**
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Improved separation of concerns
- ✅ Eliminated function conflicts
- ✅ Clean modular architecture established

**Testing:**
- System loading verified with proper dependency order
- All core TSM functions operational
- Named port registry validation working as expected

2. **✅ Process Discovery** - Find and manage orphaned TSM processes
3. **✅ JSON Output Support** - Machine-readable output for LLM agents
4. **✅ Pre-flight Validation** - Validate commands before execution

**New Diagnostic Commands:**
```bash
tsm doctor validate <command> --port <port> --env <file>  # Pre-flight validation
tsm doctor orphans [--json]                              # Find orphaned processes
tsm doctor clean                                          # Clean stale tracking files
tsm list --json                                          # Machine-readable process list
tsm start --json <command>                               # Structured startup results
```

**Enhanced Error Context:**
- Port conflict detection with PID and process details

GET /api/health/modules         # Module availability check
GET /api/monitor/events         # Real-time process monitoring
```

**Error Classification Engine:**

/json <cmd>       # Execute commands with JSON output
```

**Improved Workflow:**
