## TView Next Steps - Future Enhancements and Roadmap

## Immediate Priority Issues

### ✅ **COMPLETED: Fix Glow Return Path**
**Problem**: Users get stuck after viewing files with glow and cannot return to TView cleanly
**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ Terminal state preservation with `stty` save/restore
- ✅ Graceful fallback chain: glow → bat → less → inline highlighting
- ✅ Proper terminal reset sequence with `tput reset`
- ✅ Error handling for failed viewers
- ✅ Success/failure feedback to user

### ✅ **COMPLETED: Modal Dialog Exit Issues**
**Problem**: Drill-down detailed views (Enter key modals) don't exit cleanly
**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ Enhanced `_tview_modal_read_key()` function with multiple exit strategies
- ✅ Support for ESC, q, Q keys to exit modals
- ✅ 30-second auto-timeout to prevent stuck modals
- ✅ Consistent exit messaging across all modal dialogs
- ✅ Robust error handling for different terminal configurations

## Short-term Enhancements (Next 2-4 weeks)

**Populate Real DigitalOcean Data**:
- ✅ Integrated with NodeHolder (NH) digocean.json for live data
- ✅ Enhanced SSH configuration system with user customizations
- ✅ Multiple SSH users per environment support
- ✅ Domain-based SSH connections (user@domain.com)
- ✅ Environment mapping overrides (staging on prod server)
- ✅ Import preservation system for user customizations

**Implementation Completed**:
```bash
# Import with customization preservation
tetra org import nh ~/nh/pixeljam-arcade pixeljam_arcade
