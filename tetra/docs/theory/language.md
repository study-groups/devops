# Tetra is a Language of Change at Scale with Context-Action Transformations

## Abstract
Tetra formalizes CI/CD operations as transformations in configuration space, where Context C = {E,M} constrains Action A = {V,N} to produce typed responses. We define the module system's placeholder resolution mechanism and establish formal semantics for change propagation across infrastructure environments.

## 1. Introduction
Modern DevOps requires systematic reasoning about environment transformations. Tetra provides a mathematical framework where:
- **Contexts** C = Environment × Module types
- **Actions** A = Verbs × Nouns operating within context constraints
- **Responses** R = Typed outputs with metadata for reversibility

The core transformation follows the pattern:
```
Context × Action → Response
[E × M] × [V × N] → @channel:tag
```

## 2. Context Definition
Context acts as a constraint functor, limiting available actions based on environmental safety and module capabilities:

```
C : ENV × MOD → Set(ValidActions)
C(local, ping) = {ping/test × localhost, ping/test × #gateway}
C(prod, deploy) = {deploy/blue_green × @version, rollback × @previous}
```

**Environment Types**: E ∈ {local, dev, staging, prod}
**Module Types**: M ∈ {ping, deploy, monitor, migrate, ...}

The cross product E × M generates the constraint space where valid actions are defined.

## 3. Module Placeholder Resolution
Modules define symbolic nouns requiring runtime resolution to fully-qualified paths:

```
P: Symbolic × Env × Mod → QualifiedPath
P(#gateway, local, ping) = /etc/tetra/local/network/gateway.conf
P(#gateway, prod, ping) = https://prod.gateway.example.com
P(#config, dev, deploy) = $TETRA_DIR/config/dev/deployment.toml
```

**Formal Definition**: Let P be the resolution function mapping symbolic references to concrete paths within the module's execution context.

## 4. Action Algebra
Actions follow a verb-noun structure where verbs operate on nouns:
```
Action = Verb × Noun
show × #palette = "display color system"
deploy × #staging = "deploy to staging environment"
```

Valid actions are constrained by their generating context:
```
Actions(E,M) = {v × n | v ∈ Verbs(M) ∧ n ∈ Nouns(E,M)}
```

## 5. Change Semantics
The complete transformation represents systematic change propagation:
```
Δsystem = C(E,M) ∘ A(V,N) → R(@channel:tag, metadata)
```

Where:
- **C(E,M)** constrains available actions
- **A(V,N)** performs the transformation
- **R(@channel:tag, metadata)** carries result and rollback information

## 6. Response Types and Metadata
Responses land in typed channels with semantic tags:
- `@out:info` → Display output with informational content
- `@file:backup` → Filesystem output containing backup data
- `@pipe:metrics` → Stream output with metrics data
- `@err:timeout` → Error output with timeout information

Each response includes metadata for:
- **Source context**: (E,M,V,N) that generated the response
- **Timestamp**: When the transformation occurred
- **Rollback procedure**: How to reverse the operation
- **Resource usage**: System resources consumed

## Table of Terms

| Term | Symbol | Definition |
|------|--------|------------|
| Context | C = {E,M} | Environment × Module constraint space |
| Action | A = {V,N} | Verb × Noun transformations |
| Response | R | Typed output with rollback metadata |
| Resolution | P() | Placeholder → fully-qualified path mapping |
| Environment | E ∈ {local,dev,staging,prod} | Deployment target type |
| Module | M ∈ {ping,deploy,monitor,...} | Operational capability type |
| Placeholder | #symbol | Module-defined symbolic reference |
| Channel | @channel | Unix-style output destination |
| Tag | :tag | Semantic classification of output |
| Constraint Functor | C(E,M) | Function mapping contexts to valid actions |

## Conclusion
Tetra provides a formal foundation for infrastructure change management, combining category-theoretic precision with practical bash module systems. The Context-Action-Response pattern enables systematic reasoning about deployment operations while maintaining the flexibility required for real-world infrastructure automation.
