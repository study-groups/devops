# Tetra Introduction

Commercial DevOps platforms like AWS Systems Manager, Ansible Tower, and GitLab Enterprise introduce vendor lock-in and subscription costs that often exceed development team needs.

Tetra is a self-contained, shell-native framework that replaces multiple commercial tools while maintaining full infrastructure control. Built on standard Unix tools and bash scripting, it eliminates external dependencies and provides complete toolchain transparency. Unlike Docker-heavy solutions, Tetra uses TSM (Tetra Service Manager) as a PM2 replacement (addressing PM2's known macOS compatibility issues) with native hooks for LLM and SLM development workflows.
