# Graph - Attention - Inference - Algorithm

Gaia is a language processing model that is: 

- an example of Representational knowledge network
- uses graph convolution over hetrogeneous nodes  
- defines a phrase as triple of ${subject, verb, object}
- defines two phrases as a thought
- based off of Latent Dirichlet Allocation
