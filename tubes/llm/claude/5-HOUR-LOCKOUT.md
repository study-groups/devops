⏺ Based on my analysis of the current TUI layout and functionality, I've
  identified several critical issues that need to be addressed:

  Current Problems Identified:

  1. Input Area Styling: Currently has a bottom border only, needs purple
  outline all around
  2. Layout Structure: Complex 5-section vertical layout (top status, main
  area, input, feedback, bottom status)
  3. Command Output Location: Commands output to left panel instead of right
   viewer area
  4. Navigation Issues: Navigation system appears broken due to reloadLeft()
   calls and state management
  5. UI Introspection: Limited /ui commands, no way to list all UI elements
  6. Status Redundancy: Both top status and bottom status lines exist
  7. Feedback Positioning: Currently separate from input, should be directly
   below CLI
  8. State Management: No recallable state system for command outputs

  Analysis of Key Issues:

  Navigation Problems: The reloadLeft() calls after navigation actions are
  causing the left panel to rebuild from scratch, losing navigation state.
  The MoveUp() and MoveDown() methods work but the view refresh is broken.

  Command Output Routing: Commands currently append to m.leftContent instead
   of m.rightContent, making the right panel underutilized.

  Layout Complexity: The current 5-section layout with separate feedback
  area creates unnecessary complexity and visual clutter.

  ⎿ UI Redesign and Navigation Fix Plan

    1. Streamlined Layout Structure

    - Remove bottom status line entirely
    - Consolidate to 3-section layout: [top status] [main area] 
    [input+feedback]
    - Move feedback directly below input with 1-char border left/right
    - Add purple outline around entire input area

    2. Input Area Redesign

    - Replace current bottom-border-only style with full purple border
    - Add 1-character padding on left and right sides
    - Integrate feedback area directly below input (no separate section)
    - Make input visually prominent and contained

    3. Command Output Routing Fix

    - Redirect all command output to right panel (m.rightContent)
    - Implement state system to recall previous command outputs
    - Keep navigation tree in left panel, command results in right
    - Create history of right panel states for easy switching

    4. Navigation System Repair

    - Remove reloadLeft() calls from navigation actions
    - Fix navigation state preservation during updates
    - Ensure W/S keys work properly in left panel
    - Debug why navigation state is being lost

    5. Enhanced /ui Command System

    - Add /ui list to show all UI elements and their current values
    - Add /ui border <color> to change input border color
    - Add /ui theme <name> for theme switching
    - Expand inspection capabilities with more detail

    6. State Recall System

    - Implement command output history in right panel
    - Add /recall [n] command to switch between previous outputs
    - Store last 20 command results with metadata
    - Show state index in top status when applicable

    7. Navigation Debug and Fix

    - Investigate why navigation.MoveUp()/MoveDown() isn't working
    - Remove unnecessary left panel refreshes
    - Fix selection persistence
    - Ensure navigation arrows work consistently

    This plan will create a cleaner, more functional interface where 
    commands output to the right panel, navigation works reliably, and the 
    input area is properly highlighted and organized.
