allow mouse to select input or top. make the selection change the prompt   │
│   to a default. on the right, dont show the file but show the metadata       │
│   (file name, path) and the prompt and allow for tags. So the selector is a  │
│   cursor and the left column is a keeper of cursors. So the right side is    │
│   either showing the cursor data, or, rendering to file by 'entering' it.    │
│   We can think of awsd selector as a game controller surfing over cursors    │
│   and you enter a cursor with d and exit with a, go up and down the list     │
│   with w/d. e toggles a mutlicursor (directory of cursors) so Tubes.Cursors  │
│   is a directory of directories and cursors. The left hand side will         │
│   eventually read a directory with cursors. You can start that now but I am  │
│   more concerned about you getting the layout geometry right and make it     │
│   easier for me to add /commands and keep track of them.
