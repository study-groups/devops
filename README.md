## Docker 
- Marketing from docker.com: [Why Docker?](https://www.docker.com/why-docker) 
- [One click install vi digitalocean.com](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/one-clicks/docker/)
- [What is a container at docker.com](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)
- [Get started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) at docker.com
- Dockerfile: [Dockerfile at Docker](https://docs.docker.com/glossary/?term=Dockerfile)
- [Layers definition](https://docs.docker.com/glossary/?term=layer)
- Dont use Links. Instead use [overlay network driver](https://docs.docker.com/glossary/?term=overlay%20network%20driver)
- [Docs on Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) the preferred mechanism for data persistence
- [Doc on services](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part3/#about-services) Services are really just “containers in production.”
- Compose files: Run, and scale services with the Docker platform via [docker-compose.yml](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part3/#your-first-docker-composeyml-file)
- Overlay networks: The [overlay network driver](https://docs.docker.com/network/overlay/) creates a distributed network among multiple Docker daemon hosts. Not needed until scale.
- Networking: [Docker container networking](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/userguide/networking/#default-networks)
- Network drivers: bridge, host, overlay, 3rd-party [network drivers](https://docs.docker.com/network/#network-drivers)
- There are four major areas to consider when reviewing [Docker ecurity](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/).
