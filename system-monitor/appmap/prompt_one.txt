Project Description:
--------------------
The goal of this project is to create a directory named "appmap" that
contains essential tools and scripts for integrating AppMap with Python
applications. The centerpiece of this project is the "appmap.sh" script,
which houses bash functions prefixed with "appmap_". This script includes
at least two functions: "appmap_info", which provides general information
about AppMap, and another function that guides users through setting up
AppMap with Python, complete with a simple example encapsulated within
HEREDOC markers.

The project is designed to cater to users operating in a terminal
environment, ensuring a seamless experience whether Python is running
locally or within a Docker container. Additionally, a "requirements.txt"
file is included to manage Python dependencies.

One of the functions elaborates on integrating AppMap with Prometheus,
offering insights into monitoring and observability for applications
instrumented with AppMap.

File Structure:
---------------
- prompt_zero.txt
- appmap/
  - requirements.txt
  - appmap.sh

Key Features:
-------------
1. "appmap.sh" with bash functions starting with "appmap_".
2. Functions include "appmap_info" and a setup guide for AppMap with Python.
3. Examples provided using HEREDOC syntax, tailored for terminal users.
4. Support for Python applications running both locally and in Docker containers.
5. "requirements.txt" for managing Python dependencies.
6. Guidance on integrating AppMap with Prometheus for enhanced observability.

This project aims to streamline the process of utilizing AppMap with Python
applications, ensuring developers have the tools and knowledge needed to
enhance their application's performance and security through detailed
mapping and monitoring.
