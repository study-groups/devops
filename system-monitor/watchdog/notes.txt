One way to keep an SSH pipe open for a continuous, small volume data transfer is by using the SSH "ControlMaster" feature. 

Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. Open the SSH configuration file using a text editor.
   - On Linux/Unix-based systems: `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` or `~/.ssh/config`
   - On Windows: `C:\Users\[your_username]\.ssh\config`

2. Add the following lines at the beginning or end of the configuration file:

   ```
   Host <alias>
       ControlMaster auto
       ControlPath ~/.ssh/sockets/%r@%h-%p
       ControlPersist 4h
   ```
   Replace `<alias>` with a unique name for your SSH connection.

3. Save the changes to the configuration file.

4. Establish the initial SSH connection:
   ```
   $ ssh <alias>
   ```

   This will create a persistent socket file based on the ControlPath specified.

5. After the initial connection is established, any other SSH sessions to the same `<alias>` will reuse the existing connection:

   ```
   $ ssh <alias>
   ```

   This command will connect instantly without the need for re-authentication.

Now, you can transfer small volume data by running any commands or file transfers over this existing SSH connection without establishing a new one each time. Once the transfer is complete, the connection will still be open for future use. The `ControlPersist` option specifies how long the connection should stay open after the last connection is closed. In the example above, it is set to 4 hours (`4h`), but you can adjust it to fit your needs.
