**SUBJECT: Key Architectural Findings & Project Conventions from Auth System Debugging**

This document summarizes the critical architectural patterns and conventions discovered while resolving a series of cascading failures in the application's authentication and initialization system. Adhering to these principles is crucial for maintaining stability.

**1. The Single Source of Truth for State (Redux Store)**

*   **Finding**: The application was previously creating two separate Redux stores: one in `client/bootloader.js` and another in `client/appState.js`. This was the root cause of many state synchronization failures, as components were not connected to the store that was being updated.
*   **Convention**: The application **MUST** have only one Redux store. `client/bootloader.js` is responsible for orchestrating its creation. It uses the `initializeStore` function exported from `client/appState.js` to create and then share this single instance with the rest of the application. Never create a new store instance outside of this established flow.

**2. Staged Application Boot Sequence**

*   **Finding**: A race condition existed where the authentication check would complete before the UI components were ready to react to the state changes. Conversely, reordering the initialization caused a circular dependency, as many components require the authentication check to be complete before they can load.
*   **Convention**: The boot process in `client/bootloader.js` is deliberately staged to solve this conflict:
    1.  **Stage 1: Pre-Auth Components**: It first initializes components that have **no dependency** on the user's authentication status (e.g., `AuthDisplay`).
    2.  **Stage 2: Authentication Check**: It then runs the `checkAuth()` thunk.
    3.  **Stage 3: Post-Auth Components**: Finally, it initializes the remaining components that depend on a completed authentication check (e.g., `pathManager`, panels).
*   **Actionable Guidance**: When adding or modifying components, be mindful of this staged initialization. If a new component depends on the `auth` status, ensure it's part of the "post-auth" group.

**3. Service Initialization and Dependency Injection**

*   **Finding**: Singleton services that were imported directly (e.g., `panelStateService`) would fail because they were used before being configured with necessary dependencies like the Redux store.
*   **Convention**: Services that depend on core systems created during the boot sequence (like the store) **MUST** expose an `initialize(dependency)` method. The `bootloader.js` is responsible for calling this method at the appropriate time to inject the dependency. Avoid creating services that implicitly rely on a global state that may not exist yet.

**4. API Design Philosophy (Pragmatic vs. Pure)**

*   **Finding**: The initial auth check to `/api/auth/user` returned a `401 Unauthorized` status for logged-out users. While technically correct from a REST perspective, this created misleading "errors" in the browser console, hindering development.
*   **Convention**: For tightly-coupled, internal SPA communication, we prioritize a clean developer console over strict REST semantics. We changed the endpoint to **always return `200 OK`**, with a JSON payload indicating the authentication status (e.g., `{ "isAuthenticated": false }`). This is a deliberate design choice to reduce noise and improve debuggability. Do not "correct" this back to using `401` status codes for this specific flow.
