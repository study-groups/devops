/**
 * client/appState.js
 * Centralized application state management using Redux.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE BLUEPRINT: This file sets up the single source of truth for the application's state.
 * It combines all the individual slice reducers and applies the necessary middleware.
 *
 * Key Responsibilities:
 * 1.  **Combine Reducers:** Merges all slice reducers into a single root reducer.
 * 2.  **Apply Middleware:** Integrates essential middleware like thunks for async actions,
 *     authentication, and our robust persistence layer.
 * 3.  **Load Initial State:** Uses the `loadState` function from our persistence middleware
 *     to rehydrate the store from localStorage on application startup.
 * 4.  **Export Store:** Exports a singleton `appStore` instance for use throughout the application.
