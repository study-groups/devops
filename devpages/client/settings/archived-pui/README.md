# PUI (Pixeljam UI) - Archived Project

## Overview

PUI was an experimental declarative UI system for DevPages settings panels. This project explored a data-driven approach to building settings interfaces using JSON/JavaScript object definitions instead of imperative code.

## What Was Built

- **Declarative Schema System** - Define UI panels using JSON-like objects
- **Component Library** - 25+ reusable UI components (inputs, layouts, displays)
- **State Management Integration** - Automatic Redux store binding
- **Validation System** - Built-in and custom validators
- **Action System** - Declarative event handling
- **Styling Framework** - Complete CSS system with theme support

## Files in This Archive

- `dsui-schema.js` - Core schema definitions and renderer (22KB)
- `dsui-components.js` - Complete component library (26KB)
- `dsui-integration.js` - DevPages integration layer (13KB)
- `dsui-styles.css` - Comprehensive styling system (17KB)
- `DSUI_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Complete documentation (18KB)

## Why Archived

The current ad-hoc panel system in DevPages is working well and provides the right balance of:
- **Simplicity** - Easy to understand and modify
- **Flexibility** - Can handle unique requirements per panel
- **Performance** - Lightweight and fast
- **Integration** - Works seamlessly with existing message event conventions

The PUI approach, while powerful, was deemed too complex for the current needs. The team decided to focus on incremental improvements to the existing panel system rather than a complete architectural overhaul.

## Key Learnings

1. **Declarative UI** can reduce code duplication significantly
2. **Type safety** and validation are valuable for complex forms
3. **Component libraries** provide consistency but may be overkill for smaller projects
4. **Migration complexity** can outweigh benefits for working systems
5. **Developer familiarity** with existing patterns is valuable

## Future Considerations

If DevPages grows to need:
- 50+ settings panels
- Complex form validation across many panels
- Consistent UI patterns enforcement
- Rapid panel development by multiple developers

Then revisiting a declarative approach like PUI might be worthwhile.

## Current Approach

DevPages continues to use the successful ad-hoc panel system with:
- Individual panel classes
- Panel registry for organization
- Shared CSS design system
- Message event conventions for communication
- Incremental improvements and baby steps
