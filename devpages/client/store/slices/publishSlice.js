/**
 * @file publishSlice.js
 * @description Publish slice using Redux Toolkit createSlice pattern.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE BLUEPRINT: This slice follows the clean, refactored Redux pattern.
 * 1.  **Pure Reducers:** All reducers are pure functions that only modify the state.
 * 2.  **No Side Effects:** There are NO calls to `localStorage` or other APIs inside the slice.
 * 3.  **Centralized Persistence:** State persistence is handled declaratively by the `persistenceMiddleware`.
 *     Actions that should trigger a save are added to the middleware's whitelist.
 * 4.  **Consistent Naming:** Actions follow a clear `verbNoun` pattern.
