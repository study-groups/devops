# CURSOR AI RULES - PROJECT TEMPLATE (REVISED)
# =================================================================
# This file provides instructions to the Cursor AI.
# It helps the AI understand project-specific conventions,
# coding standards, and operational boundaries.
# =================================================================


# =================================================================
# 1. GLOBAL OPERATIONAL RULES
# =================================================================
# These are high-level instructions that apply to all interactions
# within this project.

- **NEVER attempt to start a web server.** Do not suggest or execute commands like `npm start`, `npm run dev`, or any other command that initiates a server process. Your role is to write and modify code, not to run it.
- **NEVER suggest or install new dependencies or packages** unless explicitly asked to.


# =================================================================
# 2. FILE AND DIRECTORY TREATMENT
# =================================================================
# The `notepads/` directory serves as our project's knowledge base.
# It contains reference files that should be included in prompts
# on-demand using the @ symbol (e.g., `@notepads/filename.md`).
# Do NOT assume the entire directory is relevant to every prompt.


# =================================================================
# 3. VANILLA JAVASCRIPT CODING STANDARDS
# =================================================================
# Follow these rules when writing or modifying any JavaScript (.js) files.

# General Principles:
- Write clean, modern, and readable ES6+ JavaScript.
- Prioritize clarity and maintainability over overly clever or complex code.
#- Add JSDoc comments for all functions, especially public-facing APIs.

# Variables and Declarations:
- Use `const` by default. Use `let` only for variables that must be reassigned. Avoid `var`.

# Functions:
- Prefer arrow functions (`=>`) for anonymous functions and callbacks.
- Use `async/await` for handling asynchronous operations.

# DOM Manipulation:
- Add/remove CSS classes to apply styles instead of manipulating inline styles directly.
- Use `document.querySelector` and `document.querySelectorAll`.

# Error Handling:
- Implement robust error handling with `try...catch` blocks for operations that might fail.


# =================================================================
# 4. MERMAID DIAGRAM GENERATION RULES
# =================================================================
# The following is a comprehensive guide for generating Mermaid diagrams.
# You MUST adhere to these rules strictly when asked to create or
# edit a Mermaid diagram and this guide is referenced in the prompt
# using @notepads/mermaid-002.md.

# Design Principles
- NO emojis in code or UI (ðŸš«)  
- NO flashy animations or "pulse" effects
- NO gradient backgrounds or fancy styling
- Keep UI changes minimal and functional
- Use existing design patterns, don't reinvent
- Focus on functionality over visual flair
- Simple, clean, readable code only
