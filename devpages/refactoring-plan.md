## Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 2)
1. Run `client/fix-import-paths.sh` to fix incorrect import paths ✅
2. Run `client/migration-script.js` to fix imports across the codebase
3. Run `client/disable-redundant-files.sh` to disable redundant files
4. Test the application to ensure all features still work
5. Integrate imageUploadFix.js into core/editor.js ✅
6. Integrate mermaidFix.js into core/preview.js ✅
7. Complete fileManager harmonization ✅

### Medium-term (Week 3-4)
1. Fix remaining circular dependencies 
2. Create a centralized error handler
3. Set up a consistent logging system
4. Implement UI component architecture improvements
5. Gradually migrate usage of client/fileManager/* to core/fileManager.js
6. Standardize import path handling with absolute paths for cross-directory imports
